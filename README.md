# Files Explained

*   `main.py` - the main file
*   `MazeDrawer.py` - the visualization file
*   `MummyMaze.py` - The core file that implements the reinforcement learning algorithm, using the basic backtracking algorithm
*   `MummyMaze_QLearning.py` - Basically same to the file above, but using Q-Learning algorithm
*   `png2gif.py` - The way I visualized the maze was to save the photos after each action and then press a series of images into GIFs or MP4s, which is the script to achieve the above function
*   `*.ipynb` - ignore them# MummyMaze
